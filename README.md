## Description
For my first project I used SQL and SQL-Server Management Studio to transform and remove data from a Covid data set. 
I exported the data tables into Microsoft Excel and imported the csv files into Tableau, where I visualized them.
[The dashboard can be viewed here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidViz_16520365785630/Dashboard1?:language=de-DE&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

For my second business intelligence project I decided to create a report for the fictional bicycle & accessories manufacturer AdventureWorks In Power BI. 
I cleaned up the data set by using Power BI's inbuilt functionalities and highlighted important facts 
about orders, returns, profit and revenue using DAX measures. The files for the report are in the folder AdventureWorks BI Report.<br>
